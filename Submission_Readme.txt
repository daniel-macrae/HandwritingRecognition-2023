Group 9 HWR Code Submission

Because the model weights for task 3 are large (~4GB), we opted to submit the code for both tasks via Google Drive. A folder containing a .zip file for each task can be found at:

Both tasks are run in a conda environment, with more detailed instructions on how to set up and use the code written in the README files for each task.
